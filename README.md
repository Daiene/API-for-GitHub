This project allows the user to enter someone's username and search their GitHub information, resulting in their profile picture, name, location, biography, and repositories.

## About
API for GitHub was born with the intention of bringing me knowledge about an API request. Until then, I had never had contact with API, this being my first time.

So the challenge was to create a custom interface with a LinkedIn theme, created by me. In it, we have a text box that will receive the user's username and clicking on the search button, it returns some information from GitHub, such as photo, name, location, biography and repositories.

In addition to fulfilling the objective of learning what an API is and how to use it, I got to know Insomnia, which was of great value for the development of the JavaScript code for the API.
